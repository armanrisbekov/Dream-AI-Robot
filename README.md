# 🤖 Dream AI Robot: From English Lesson to Code

This project has a special story. It started as a simple English class assignment where students had to draw a robot and write an essay. Instead of just drawing, I decided to build a **digital interactive version** using code.

## 📖 The Story
As mentioned in my **Recommendation Letter** from my English teacher:
*"Arman built a fully interactive mini-application... This project went far beyond the assignment, showcasing Arman’s incredible creativity and technical skill."*

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Beyond Sketches:** Turning a traditional paper-and-pen assignment into a functional web app.
* **Multilingual Vision:** Concept of a robot that speaks Kazakh, Turkish, and English.
* **Future Ambition:** A symbol of my journey towards becoming a Computer Engineer in Türkiye.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
* HTML5 & CSS3 (Animations)
* Concept of Speech Synthesis & Interaction



## 🤖 This is how the AI assistant looks:
